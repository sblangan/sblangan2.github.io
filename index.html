    <h1>My Favorite Things of the Moment</h1>
    <h2>A listing of what I'm currently obsessed with</h2>
    <p>Summer is a great time to enjoy the little things. Here's the Top 3 things that have been bringing me more joyh in the everyday!</p>
    <h3>Number 1: Enneagrams</h3>
<img src="https://www.integrative9.com/images/EnneagramWheel-solid-middle.png alt="enneagram chart" style=width:"400px" height:"400px";>
    <p>The Enneagram of Personality typifies individuals into 9 "types". Are you a "Helper", an "Achiever", an "Individualist"? Personally, I'm a 7--the Enthusiast. Everyone should take the time to find their personality type. It's revealing and insightful. Take the <a href="https://www.eclecticenergies.com/enneagram/dotest">test</a> here.</p>
    <h3>Number 2: Soccer</h3>
    <p>The Women's World Cup captured my attention far more that I thought it would. Now I've found myself trying to learn everything about this beautiful game! The best resource on the web to get soccer news is <a href=https://www.feedspot.com/>Feedspot</a>, a comprehensive news feed that pulls soccer news from the best soccer resources online. Give it a try!</p>
    <h3>Number 3: French Macarons</h3>
    <p>Is there anything more quintessentially French? These old school desserts are getting clever facelifts thanks to some of the world's top macaron makers. My personal favorite is <a href="https://www.ma-ka-rohn.com/">Makarohn</a>, a Miami-based bakery with fierce creativity. Seriously, order their Harry Potter collection. They ship!</p>
